# Terraform Environment Variables (EXAMPLE)
# Copy this file to set-env.ps1 and fill in your actual subscription ID
# 
# Usage:
#   In PowerShell: . .\set-env.ps1
#   (The dot-space-dot means "source" the file in the current session)

# Azure Subscription ID
$env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "your-azure-subscription-id"

# Optional: You can also set these if you prefer environment variables over terraform.tfvars
# $env:ARM_CLIENT_ID = "your-client-id"
# $env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = "your-client-secret"
# $env:ARM_TENANT_ID = "your-tenant-id"
